Adds notes to test names in Test::Builder-based test scripts. Each
Test::NameNote object encapsulates a singe note, which will be added to the
names of all tests run while the object is in scope.

  use Test::More tests => 10;
  use Test::NameNote;

  ok foo(), "foo true";
  foreach my $foo (0, 1) {
      my $n1 = Test::NameNote->new("foo=$foo");
      foreach my $bar (0, 1) {
          my $n2 = Test::NameNote->new("bar=$bar");
          is thing($foo, $bar), "thing", "thing returns thing";
          is thang($foo, $bar), "thang", "thang returns thang";
      }
  }
  ok bar(), "bar true";

  # prints:
  1..10
  ok 1 - foo true
  ok 2 - thing returns thing (foo=0,bar=0)
  ok 3 - thang returns thang (foo=0,bar=0)
  ok 4 - thing returns thing (foo=0,bar=1)
  ok 5 - thang returns thang (foo=0,bar=1)
  ok 6 - thing returns thing (foo=1,bar=0)
  ok 7 - thang returns thang (foo=1,bar=0)
  ok 8 - thing returns thing (foo=1,bar=1)
  ok 9 - thang returns thang (foo=1,bar=1)
  ok 10 - bar true
